## TODO: 
1. Would like to change iter_all_posts function so it downloads questions that haven't been stored yet
2. Add a linter
3. Add a different template for posts that are notes
4. Add weights to documents
5. Some answers are formatted in html or md, make them into plain text when downloading
6. Need to make embedded links accessible
7. Add more documents:
    - B&O textbook
    - Slide decks
    - Specs
    - Random stuff from the calendar
8. Would be cool if you could select which homework you're working on, kind of like selecting a folder
    for a Piazza post...
9. Ensure that there are no contradictory answers:
    - Make a training dataset of questions
    - Ensure the answers are correct
    - Negate all of the questions
    - See what responses LLM produces
10. Answers need to have links to documentation
    - I can incorporate this relatively easily
11. Obviously this was forked from someone else's repo, so would like to remove all the unnecessary 
    stuff that's in here
12. Update the .gitignore file
13. Chan
