In file app.py

    The initial page is loaded. Nothing much will appear until your OPENAI_API_KEY is inputted
    Then, the function update_chain() is run. The data_source variable holds the string
    constant DEFAULT_DATA_SOURCE. Then, the function get_chain() is called. Within this function
    the get_vector_store() function is called with the data_source, options and credentials
    variables as parameters. Within the get_vector_store() funciton, the get_embeddings
    function is called with options and credentials vars as parameters. 
        The default embedding model is openai, but not sure if this costs money? Could
        maybe change in models.py in class MODELS
        Anyways...
    The embedding model is returned from the get_embeddings function. Next, the
    get_dataset_path() function is called.
